<p class="testimonial-content">"This will be my third year working out with Meryl as a personal trainer.
I *very* highly recommend her. I went to Meryl because I wanted to add strength training to my running routine
to try and break through a plateau I felt that I had reached by running alone. I also wanted to develop core
strength that I just wasn't getting from running more miles.
<br/>
<br/>
The training program Meryl developed for me was personalized for what I wanted to achieve, for where I was,
and for the way life shifts things around. If we shifted days relative to my training runs, she would adjust
the focus areas for our workout as needed. She also adjusted some of the exercises to account for an injury I
have. This helped me always make forward progress in our workouts no matter when we had them.
<br/>
<br/>
During our training sessions, Meryl encouraged me, and pushed me to get better. She also learned to read me;
to know when I could and should do more or when I was already pushing too much. After my first season
working with Meryl I was able to get a half marathon PR.  I definitely attribute the success I had in that
race to the strength that Meryl helped me get in our workouts.
<br/>
<br/>
She is very supportive, and brings a positive energy into the workouts that helps motivate you through them.
She is also patient and teaches you the right way to do exercises to make sure you are getting most out of
your time and the work you're doing. And she listens to what is working and keeps track of  how your body is
responding to the training.
<br/>
<br/>
Meryl is a rare combination of someone who is a good teacher, a positive energy and an expert who can adapt
to the varying needs, goals and capabilities of her clients."</p>

<p class="testimonial-content">"Meryl Carey is a fantastic trainer that will keep you focused and on track with 
whatever your workout goals may be. She blends patience, motivation, knowledge, toughness and quality into each 
of her client's sessions. 
<br/>
<br/>
I've been training with her for a little over two years and she is an integral part of why I enjoy working out 
now. I've had other trainers before, but her workouts are perfect for my busy schedule. She is extremely 
efficient in the time that we have together, allowing me to set personal goals that I never dreamed of being 
able to achieve. I'm a mom of four kids (boy and triplet girls) AND I am now also a state power lifting record 
holder! I highly recommend Meryl as a trainer regardless of your workout experience. Beginner to professional 
athlete - you will achieve great things with her as your coach."</p>

<p class="testimonial-content">"I've been working out with Meryl for two years, and I can't say enough about
how fantastic she is. She's actually better than she has to be - knowledgeable, patient, and willing to work
hard for her people. She is a total badass, but she's really in it for the success of her clients. She says
she doesn't judge. You know - I say that too. The difference is - she actually means it. I've never heard
her say anything about any of her clients that isn't positive (if she says anything at all). She maintains
a level of professionalism that's hard to find. Meryl always knows when to push harder, and she's always
making sure my form is right. She'll also be the first on to suggest we back off. (I can be a little
stubborn.) She knows how to challenge me (I don't respond to yelling btw), and I think she uses different
tactics on different clients. She's Obi Wan. The best for you, she wants.
<br/>
<br/>
I've just started bringing my husband with me, so we now train together. We got our first consult/trial
workout for free; so you can try before you buy, which helped us answer a few questions we had about working
out together as a couple. How much would that change our workout dynamic? (between me and Meryl, that is)
She is able to tailor to both of us at once, despite our different strengths/abilities, while keeping us in
proper form, which is pretty spectacular. She has price points for small groups too, so you could go with
your friends. That beats a book club, I tell ya. There is a commitment involved, and I was worried about
that because my schedule can be weird; but when I have appointments or work travel, she works with my
schedule, which I really appreciate. It's a win-win-win."</p>

<p class="testimonial-content">"I'd not been in a weight room in years and was starting to feel the effects
of being a big guy 6'5" and 230 pounds. My back was sore and posture bad. Meryl got me on track right away.
She pushed me when I needed it and always kept me gaining ground. Results happened fast and she got me on a
routine and inspired me to keep on it. She's a great trainer, with great personality and really listens to
what you want to accomplish."</p>

<p class="testimonial-content">"I love training with Meryl! She is a POWERHOUSE! Meryl is very attentive and
pays close attention to me as an INDIVIDUAL, not just another body or session. Her well-rounded training
philosophy keeps workouts challenging and interesting. Her personal fitness and competition experience
combined with her education and dedication to her trade give her a unique edge that I have not experienced
with any other Trainers.
<br/>
<br/>
She packs a mean workout into 30 minutes and her quiet strength gives me the confidence and motivation to
work through the challenges she customizes for my sessions. I love that I can get in, rock an amazing
workout and get out in 30 minutes! She's always on time, very professional, and through all her structure,
I still feel like she genuinely cares for my well-being and needs on a personal level. Train with Meryl!
You won't be disappointed!"</p>
