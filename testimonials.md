"I love training with Meryl! She is a POWERHOUSE! Meryl is very attentive and pays close attention to me as an INDIVIDUAL, not just another body or session. Her well-rounded training philosophy keeps workouts challenging and interesting. Her personal fitness and competition experience combined with her education and dedication to her trade give her a unique edge that I have not experienced with any other Trainers.

She packs a mean workout into 30 minutes and her quiet strength gives me the confidence and motivation to work through the challenges she customizes for my sessions. I love that I can get in, rock an amazing workout and get out in 30 minutes! She's always on time, very professional, and through all her structure, I still feel like she genuinely cares for my well-being and needs on a personal level. Train with Meryl! You won't be disappointed!"

<span class="testimonial-content">"I'd not been in a weight room in years and was starting to feel the effects of being a big guy 6'5" and 230 pounds. My back was sore and posture bad. Meryl got me on track right away. She pushed me when I needed it and always kept me gaining ground. Results happened fast and she got me on a routine and inspired me to keep on it. She's a great trainer, with great personality and really listens to what you want to accomplish."</span>

<span class="testimonial-content">"I've been working out with Meryl for two years, and I can't say enough about how fantastic she is. She's actually better than she has to be - knowledgeable, patient, and willing to work hard for her people. She is a total badass, but she's really in it for the success of her clients. She says she doesn't judge. You know - I say that too. The difference is - she actually means it. I've never heard her say anything about any of her clients that isn't positive (if she says anything at all). She maintains a level of professionalism that's hard to find. Meryl always knows when to push harder, and she's always making sure my form is right. She'll also be the first on to suggest we back off. (I can be a little stubborn.) She knows how to challenge me (I don't respond to yelling btw), and I think she uses different tactics on different clients. She's Obi Wan. The best for you, she wants.</span>  
<span class="testimonial-content">I've just started bringing my husband with me, so we now train together. We got our first consult/trial workout for free; so you can try before you buy, which helped us answer a few questions we had about working out together as a couple. How much would that change our workout dynamic? (between me and Meryl, that is) She is able to tailor to both of us at once, despite our different strengths/abilities, while keeping us in proper form, which is pretty spectacular. She has price points for small groups too, so you could go with your friends. That beats a book club, I tell ya. There is a commitment involved, and I was worried about that because my schedule can be weird; but when I have appointments or work travel, she works with my schedule, which I really appreciate. It's a win-win-win."</span>
