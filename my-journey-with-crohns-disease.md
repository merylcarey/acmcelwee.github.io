After a year of struggling with severe health issues, I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease,
a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn’s is currently incurable, extremely debilitating,
sometimes fatal, and is often hidden from the public eye. To help promote greater awareness,
I’m asking for your support to raise funds for the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA).
On May 19th, CCFA will host its 10th annual Take Steps Walk at The Long Center in Austin. Your
donations will further promote the effort to discover a cure for inflammatory bowel disease.
Please consider supporting this cause; every penny will bring us closer to fighting this disease.

[PLEASE DONATE HERE](http://online.ccfa.org/site/TR/TakeSteps/Chapter-HoustonGulfCoastSouthTexas?px=3519873&pg=personal&fr_id=7398){:target="_blank"} -- No amount is too small :)

[JOIN MY TEAM](http://online.ccfa.org/site/TR/TakeSteps/Chapter-HoustonGulfCoastSouthTexas?px=3519873&pg=personal&fr_id=7398){:target="_blank"}
and come walk with me on May 19th. The more the merrier!

My journey with Crohn’s began in 2016. Sudden onset of severe intestinal trauma resulted in
surgery, followed by a year of medical procedures and further hospitalizations. I was bedridden
on and off for a year, unable to walk or eat food. My life turned upside down. Basic functions
of daily living became too demanding and I was forced to withdraw from my Personal Training
business. Living with Crohn’s led to a downward spiral into depression and increasing physical
disability. Completely crushed and isolated, hopelessness soon crept in.

After one year’s search for relief, undergoing many unsuccessful treatments and trial medications,
I eventually discovered my wonderful IBD specialist who skillfully guided my treatment plan.
Together with the help of my loving family, dear friends and my specialist medical team, I was
able to slowly regain my health and strength. Just as suddenly it seemed life’s simple pleasures
– walking in the sun, laughing with friends, and returning to normalcy became a real possibility.
Now I’m rebuilding my Personal Training business, qualifying as a Nutritionist, and embarking on a
journey to become a Yoga Instructor, all of which I will apply to help others improve their health
and well-being.

Despite the enormous challenge Crohn’s has been (and will continue to be), I view this experience
as a gift. Illness taught me to slow down and live in the moment, to value patience and perseverance,
and to never take my health for granted. Suffering has given me the strength and passion to inspire
and empower others who may be in need. Whatever trial you are facing, whatever obstacle is thrown
your way, you too can find the strength to persevere. Always hold onto hope and never give up!
