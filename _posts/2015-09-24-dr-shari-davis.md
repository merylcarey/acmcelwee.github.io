Shari and I are celebrating our 4 year anniversary of training together, and throughout those 4 years I have 
watched her evolve into the amazing athlete that she is today. Back in 2011, Shari had never lifted a single 
weight. Today, she is a respectable Powerlifting Athlete who competes in the Masters division (age 50-54) and 
holds State, American, and World records! If that doesn't prove that you can reach your goals and achieve the 
'impossible', I don't know what does. Shari's love for the sport has given her goals to continuously strive for. 
She trains 4 times a week and is constanly increasing strength and improving her personal records, that's what we 
like to call GAINS. She's currently aiming to squat over 200lb and deadlift over 300lb. Ultimately, she wants 
to obtain a Master level which will qualify her for Nationals. You can do it Shari, keep training hard and 
believing in yourself!

> "Powerlifting has provided me with physical activity that is both physically & mentally challenging. Training 
& lifting have provided me with a confidence that permeates all areas of my life - personal and professional. 
I believe training will increase my chances of lifelong health while decreasing the effects of aging such 
as falls, broken bones, & stability.  
<br/>
"Find a physical activity that you enjoy and do it. If powerlifting is something 
you're considering, go to a meet and get a sense of the energy among the lifters as well as the encouraging and 
supportive environment. Powerlifting is a sport that one can start to train for later in life without any athletic background. I view 
it as stealth cardio. The ability to lift heavy weights provides a feeling of being empowered. Being strong is 
an ego boost."
