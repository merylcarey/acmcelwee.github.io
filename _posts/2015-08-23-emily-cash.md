Emily Cash deserves to be recognized for her commitment and dedication to her health and fitness. 
Emily has lost a whopping 30lbs since April 2015 and feels better than ever before! The amazing accomplishments 
of this inspiring young woman prove that you CAN change, and you CAN reach your goals, no matter how far away 
they may seem. I believe that it is Emily's positive attitude and consistent hard work that enabled her to reach her goals.

> "I recently had to run through an airport and I didn't feel like I was going to have a heart attack. I also went 
paddle boarding for the first time and was able to jump from a kneeling to squatting position with ease. I NEVER 
have been that fit to do that before! I've lost 30 pounds so far while increasing muscle mass and seeing/feeling 
muscles I never knew I had. I still have another 30 pounds to go but I know I'm getting there in a way that is, 
for once in my life, healthy."  
<br/>
"I have a lot of confidence, I am starting to feel more comfortable in my clothes 
again and the best part is that people have noticed. They've noticed not just the weight loss, but more importantly 
the confidence I'm exuding because I feel stronger and fitter. Seeing results keeps me motivated to keep going!"
