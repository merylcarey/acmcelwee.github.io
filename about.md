I'm proud to call Austin home and love the active, healthy, and adventurous nature of the city. I moved here to obtain my B.S. in Kinesiology from UT and quickly fell in love with the place. I came here with a diverse background, originally being from Scotland and having lived in Oman, Chile, and New Orleans.  

I have harbored a true zeal for fitness since childhood, competing in Gymnastics, Dance, Swimming, Track, and Powerlifting. In my first Powerlifting meet in 2012, I broke Texas state records in the squat, bench, and deadlift categories. Most recently I have developed a passion for Figure Competition, securing my Pro Card in my first competition. Along with my love for sports, I simply enjoy being active, eating healthy food, and exploring new hobbies. My hope is to encourage people to find enjoyment in exercise and feel good about themselves. I enjoy sharing my passion for health and fitness with those around me, with the ultimate goal of helping others to lead healthier, happier lives!
