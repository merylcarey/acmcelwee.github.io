Originally from Scotland, I have had the privilege of traveling the world; living in Oman, Chile, New Orleans, and Houston. I'm happy to now call Austin home, having moved here to earn my B.S. in Kinesiology from UT. I have always harbored a true zeal for fitness and sports, competing in Gymnastics, Dance, Swimming, Track, and Powerlifting. In 2012, I broke Texas state records in the squat, bench, and deadlift. Most recently I have developed a passion for Figure Competition, securing my Pro Card in my first competition. I enjoy sharing my passion for health and fitness with those around me, with the ultimate goal of helping others to lead healthier, happier lives!
