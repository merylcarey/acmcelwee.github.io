It is such a privilege to work in the health and fitness industry! Through sharing my
passion for health and fitness, I am able to have a positive effect on the lives of others. I
have harbored a true zeal for fitness since childhood, competing in gymnastics, dance,
swimming, track, and powerlifting. In 2012, I went on a 70-day charity bike ride, in which
I raised $8,000 for cancer research and cycled 4,000 miles from Austin to Alaska. That
was enough cycling for a lifetime, so I later switched gears to powerlifting. In my first
powerlifting meet, I broke Texas state records in the squat, bench, and deadlift,
qualifying for the 2014 World Championships. I also developed a passion for figure
competitions, securing my pro card in my very first show. Throughout my athletic
endeavors, I have suffered several injuries and overcome many challenges, allowing
me to become a more patient, knowledgeable, and compassionate Trainer.

My most recent challenge has been a hard one to swallow. For the past year I have
struggled with a severe illness, and in January 2017 I was diagnosed with Crohn’s
disease, a chronic autoimmune disorder which can be debilitating and life threatening.
Considering I had been healthy and fit my entire life, I was shocked and devastated
upon hearing my diagnosis. The illness hit me out of nowhere in May 2016, and since
then I have endured numerous hospitalizations, ER visits, surgeries, tests, and
procedures. At times I have been bedridden and unable to eat, leading to severe fatigue
and weight loss. As a personal trainer and fitness enthusiast, it was painful to watch my
body change in ways that I never anticipated.

The Crohn’s diagnosis plus the drastic lifestyle changes it imposes have been difficult to
adopt and accept. However, my struggles and lessons have helped to hone my skills as
a personal trainer. My nutritional knowledge has greatly expanded through monitoring
my diet and incorporating healing foods and proper cooking methods into my daily
lifestyle. My journey has been long and arduous, but I continue to persevere, hold my
head high, and put one foot in front of the other. I choose to embrace each day and to
appreciate all the love that I’m surrounded by. I choose to focus on what I CAN do, and
hope that sharing my story will help to empower and inspire others. One needn’t be
defined by their limitations; it’s what you do in spite of your limitations that defines you.

I moved to Austin in 2008 to obtain my B.S. in Kinesiology at UT and fell in love with the
active and adventurous nature of the city. Originally from Scotland, I have also lived in
Oman, Chile, New Orleans, and Houston. I enjoy connecting with people from diverse
backgrounds and thrive on hearing each person’s unique story. Despite our
individuality, I believe that every person is equally capable of reaching their
goals with commitment, determination, and a positive mindset. My passion lies in serving as a
guide toward those goals through accountability, encouragement and sharing my fitness
secrets I’ve learned along the way.
