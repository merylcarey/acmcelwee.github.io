It is a privilege to be in the Personal Training industry. Through sharing my passion for health and fitness, I am able to have a positive effect
on the lives of others. I have harbored a true zeal for fitness since childhood, competing in Gymnastics, Dance, Swimming, Track, and Powerlifting. 
In 2012, I partook in a 70-day charity bike ride, in which I raised $8,000 for cancer research and cycled 4,000 miles from Austin to Alaska! That was 
enough cycling for a lifetime, so I later switched gears to powerlifting. In my first Powerlifting meet, I broke Texas state records in the squat, bench, 
and deadlift, qualifying myself for the 2014 World Championships. Most recently I have developed a passion for Figure Competition, securing my Pro 
Card in my very first competition. Throughout my athletic endeavors, I have suffered several injuries and tackled many obstacles, allowing me to 
become a more patient, knowledgeable, and compassionate Trainer.
 
I am proud to call Austin home. I moved here in 2008 to obtain my B.S. in Kinesiology at UT and fell in love with the active and adventurous 
nature of the city. Originally from Scotland, I have also lived in Oman, Chile, and New Orleans. I enjoy connecting with people from a diverse 
background and thrive on hearing each person’s unique story. I believe that, despite our individuality, every person is equally capable of reaching 
their individual health and fitness goals with the right commitment and determination. My passion lies in serving as a guide toward those goals 
through accountability, encouragement and sharing my fitness secrets I’ve learned along the way.
